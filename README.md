OpenQbo --- HYDRO  --- 
=======

  A Repository for the Qbo Robot stacks and associated files running under ROS "Hydro"-Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) 64-bit. Browse the git branches for more compatible versions for the different ROS releases. 


  To install these stacks you must create a "/stacks" folder in your "/opt/ros/hydro/" folder and install all the directories and files in this Repo. Also there are folders I have labeled "Dependencies" in some stacks that may have necessary files and or instructions for proper installation. There are also default pages labeled "control" in each stack that also have information on dependencies written by "The Corpora's" factory release that may also help with installation.  
 
  Python2.6 needs to be installed under Ubuntu 12.04 to run some portions of code in this repository. Use apt-get.  

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes 
  
  sudo apt-get update                                
  
  sudo apt-get install python2.6 python2.6-dev
