OpenQbo  --- Jade ---
=======

A backup Repository for the Qbo Robot ROS "Jade" Stacks and associated files for Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr). Browse the git branches for compatible versions for the different ROS releases.

To install these stacks you must create a "/stacks/Qbo" folder in your "/opt/ros/jade/" folder and install all the directories and files in this Repo. Also there are folders I have labeled "Dependencies" in some stacks that may have necessary files and or instructions for proper installation. There are also default pages labeled "control" in each stack that also have information on dependencies written by "The Corpora's" factory release that may also help with installation.
