OpenQbo
=======

  A Repository for the Qbo Robot stacks and associated files running under ROS "Hydro". Browse the git branches for more compatible versions for the different ROS releases. 


  To install these stacks you must create a "/stacks" folder in your "/opt/ros/hydro/" folder and install all the directories and files in this Repo. Also there are folders I have labeled Dependencies in each stack that may have necessary files and or instructions for proper installation.
