OpenQbo
=======

  A Repository for the Qbo Robot stacks and associated files running under ROS "Hydro"-Ubuntu 12.04 (precise) 64-bit. Browse the git branches for more compatible versions for the different ROS releases. 


  To install these stacks you must create a "/stacks" folder in your "/opt/ros/hydro/" folder and install all the directories and files in this Repo. Also there are folders I have labeled Dependencies in each stack that may have necessary files and or instructions for proper installation. 
 
  Python2.6 needs to be installed under Ubuntu 12.04 to run some portions of code in this repository. Use apt-get.  

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes      ...
  sudo apt-get update                                ...
  sudo apt-get install python2.6 python2.6-dev
