Version 2.02                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  s
To run this script you need to have installed Julius and an acoustic model for the grammar

 
Usage: gengram sentencefilename phonemsfilename tiedlist destfilename
        Config file: Name of the file with the sentences
        phonemsfilename: Name of the phonems file
        tiedlist: HMMlist file
        destfilename: Name of the gramar, voca, dict to be created
Config file format:
        Use \[\] to create labels.
        Use \{\} to reference labels.
        Label 'sentences' is always needed.
        In a label you can referer another label.
        Do not make loops.
        Do not add silences, it will be added automatically.
        Example:

                John
                Rambo
                [objects]
                {desktop_objects}
                {other_objects}
                newspaper
                [sentences]
                what is this

                my name is {name}
                [desktop_objects]
                pen
                screen
                [other_objects]
                mask
                newspaper
phonemsfile 2 possible format:
        ANDS            ae n d z
        ANDUILLE                ae n d uw iy

        ANDS   [ANDS]         ae n d z
        ANDUILLE   [ANDUILLE]             ae n d uw iy

=== Example ===
Remember: To run this script you need to have installed Julius and an acoustic model for the grammar

You can find in the example directory an acoustic model and a config file which you can easily compile:
./gen_grammar.py example/LM/sentences.conf example/AM/phonems example/AM/tiedlist example/LM/default


After executing this all this files will be generated:
example/LM/default/default.dfa
example/LM/default/default.dict
example/LM/default/default.grammar
example/LM/default/default.term
example/LM/default/default.voca
