'''
The SDP offer/answer model for unicast sessions.

Suppose the offerer wants to support PCMU and PCMA audio and H261 video, it can
use the following code to generate the offer SDP.

from std.rfc4566 import SDP, attrs as format
from std.rfc3264 import createOffer, createAnswer

>>> audio = SDP.media(media='audio', port='9000')
>>> audio.fmt = [format(pt=0, name='PCMU', rate=8000), format(pt=8, name='PCMA', rate=8000)]
>>> video = SDP.media(media='video', port='9002')
>>> video.fmt = [format(pt=31, name='H261', rate=90000)] 
>>> offer = createOffer([audio, video])
>>>
>>> offer.o.sessionid = offer.o.version = 1192000146 # so that testing doesn't depend on time
>>> offer.o.address = '192.168.1.66'                    # or IP address
>>> print str(offer).replace('\\r', '\\\\r').replace('\\n', '\\\\n')
v=0\\r\\no=- 1192000146 1192000146 IN IP4 192.168.1.66\\r\\ns=-\\r\\nt=0 0\\r\\nm=audio 9000 RTP/AVP 0 8\\r\\na=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000\\r\\na=rtpmap:8 PCMA/8000\\r\\nm=video 9002 RTP/AVP 31\\r\\na=rtpmap:31 H261/90000\\r\\n

When the offer is received by the answerer, it can use the following code to generate
the answer. Suppose the answerer wants to support PCMU and GSM audio and no video.

from std.rfc4566 import SDP, attrs as format
from std.rfc3264 import createAnswer
>>> audio = SDP.media(media='audio', port='8020')
>>> audio.fmt = [format(pt=0), format(pt=3)]  # for known payload types, description is optional
>>> answer = createAnswer([audio], offer)
>>>
>>> answer.o.sessionid = answer.o.version = 1192000146 
>>> answer.o.address = '192.168.1.66'
>>> print str(answer).replace('\\r', '\\\\r').replace('\\n', '\\\\n')
v=0\\r\\no=- 1192000146 1192000146 IN IP4 192.168.1.66\\r\\ns=-\\r\\nt=0 0\\r\\nm=audio 8020 RTP/AVP 0\\r\\na=rtpmap:0 PCMU/8000\\r\\nm=video 0 RTP/AVP 31\\r\\na=rtpmap:31 H261/90000\\r\\n

Suppose the offerer wants to change the offer (e.g., using SIP re-INVITE) by removing
video from the offer; it should reuse the previous offer as follows:

newOffer = createOffer([audio], offer)
